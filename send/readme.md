# Actual Buttons

This is the source for the actual physical buttons.  There might be a few ways to do this

### Python + usb gamepad

Using the first button on a usb gamepad. Might be good for raspberry pi scripts.

* [pygame](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/issues/82/homebrew-on-leopard-fails-to-install#comment-627494)
* `pip install -U python-dotenv`
* `pip install pusher`
* `brew tap homebrew/python`
* `brew install pygame`

```bash
python button.py
```


### Node/browser + usb gamepad

Probably a good fallback if network is hard to set up on the pi. Using webGamepads because it seems more stable than other node libraries

```bash
node web_backend

# open localhost:8080 in chrome
```
